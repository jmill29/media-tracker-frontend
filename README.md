# Media Tracker Frontend – Future Expansion Project ![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coverage-80%25-brightgreen) [![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in_progress-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/jmill29/media-tracker-frontend)

This is the upcoming **React-based frontend** for the Media Tracker project — a full-stack app originally built as part of my Cognixia Capstone. The frontend will interact with a secure Spring Boot REST API to let users track their **TV shows**, **books**, and **music** — managing not just what they consume, but when and how their preferences evolve over time.

---

## 🎯 Vision & Objective

To build a modern, responsive, and scalable frontend that integrates with the Media Tracker API and provides users with an intuitive way to:

- Track media they've consumed or plan to enjoy
- View detailed watch/listen/read history timelines
- Log status updates across multiple categories (TV, Books, Music)
- Register, authenticate, and manage their personal media preferences

---

## 🔮 Key Upcoming Features

- 🔐 **JWT-Based Authentication** (replacing Basic Auth & JdbcUserDetailsManager)
- ⚛️ **React SPA** for a sleek, interactive UI
- 📊 **Dashboard** view of watch/listen/read activity over time
- 🖼️ **Dynamic media cards** with cover art, summaries, and status tags
- 🔄 **Real-time status updates** using optimistic UI
- 📁 **Modular structure** with React Router, Axios, Context API
- 🌐 **Cloud Deployment**: 
  - Backend: AWS ECS or Fargate
  - Frontend: AWS S3 + CloudFront CDN

## 🚧 Current Status

This frontend is currently in the early planning and scaffolding phase. The Java CLI version, which served as the original frontend for the capstone, has been archived and is being replaced by this React application to support:

- A broader set of media types
- More sophisticated UI/UX
- Fully token-based secure user flows

## 📸 Planned UI Preview

> 🖼️ *Early preview mockups will be added here soon.*  
Stay tuned for screenshots and demo links as development progresses.

## 🧠 Background

The original capstone was built in under 2 weeks, including a full week learning Spring Boot from scratch. Now, with the fundamentals locked in, I’m taking it a step further and building this frontend for production-readiness — and to sharpen my skills in modern web development and cloud deployment.

## 🙌 Thank You

Thanks again to Cognixia for laying the foundation. The capstone taught me more than just frameworks — it showed me how to break problems down, learn fast, and ship real solutions under tight deadlines. This repo represents the next stage in that journey.
